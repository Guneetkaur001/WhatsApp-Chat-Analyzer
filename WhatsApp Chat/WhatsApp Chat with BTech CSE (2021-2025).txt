c.  Examination of existing technical literature, survey, including journals, articles, research reports, and related national / international reports if any.
d.  Horizon scanning of the entire quality ecosystem for identification of key stakeholders like leading manufacturers (both large and small scale covering the entire spectrum of industry), organized users and target groups, testing laboratories, R&D institutions etc.
e.  Interaction with stakeholders including visit to manufacturers / labs and stakeholders’ meetings.

27/10/23, 12:05 pm -  CR1: Hi guys Regarding MOOC:

There r two situations 
If u want to give paper in dept then there is no need to give online quizzes and no need to register as well 

If anyone wants to take  online certificates they should inform the dept before and after giving your paper
27/10/23, 12:47 pm -  CR1: Online exam may be similar to other online exam like jee.
27/10/23, 1:35 pm -  CR1: # Mooc subject 

No online exam will be conducted by the department. MOOC Paper will be in the normal offline mode. Don’t create confusion among the students.

As far as Courses at SWAYAM are concerned, SWAYAM provide opportunity to the student to get certificate/certification of the course they are studying. In that case paper will be conducted by NTA, student have to register and pay fees online. Student needs to go at the particular testing center (like ion) which will be allocated by the NTA itself.
27/10/23, 1:52 pm -  CR1: The students who are interested in online exam for mooc id and want to have certificate for course can pay the fees and they have to inform the department that they are giving exam online. Otherwise the department will conduct the regular exam. There is no need to give exam again in department if you are giving it online.

This is because, while doing the registration the student have chosen *"completed the degree in stipulated time"* instead of *"currently pursuing"*. Because of this the students are landing in *not eligible* bucket, we regret that we cannot do anything as per policy, if the candidate is landing in not eligible bucket by filling incorrect details while doing the registration. 

Requesting you to please inform all the candidates to fill all the details very carefully.

03/09/24, 2:16 pm -  CR1: Dear Sir/Madam,

KPMG conducted campus placement at GNDU, Amritsar on 28-29 August, 2024 and selected 16 students from GNDU of Batch 2025.

The company provided valuable feedback, which I would like to share with all the concerned HOD's and Placement-in-Charge's :

1. The students need to improvise on following :
   - Presentability for interview process
   - CV Data and Validation of Information
   - Domain Knowledge
   - Soft Skills

2. It was seen that few students were not wearing formals during the Group Discussion and interviews. The students need to be instructed to wear formals during the placement process.

3. The CVs of the students were not relevant and updated. Teacher Placement-in-Charge's can guide the students in preparation of the CVs.

These important feedback points need to be shared with all the batches of B.Tech. students of your department, so that we can have better results in future.

Therefore, students having old CT / DT IDs, are advised to send their details in the attached format through their respective Placement-in-Charge's.

If candidates from your institute get selected post final interview/assessment, they will be joining us for a 6-month residential bootcamp at SDI Bhubaneswar. If they perform well during these six months, they will receive a final offer from our side after clearing the final assessment. To address any questions related to the bootcamp, we are sharing an FAQ document which will provide answers to your queries.

 

Lastly, as discussed, since this is a 6-month residential program, we would need a go-ahead from the Training and Placement Office to confirm the participation of these candidates. Therefore, we are sharing a NOC template for your perusal, which will come into effect if any candidates from the above list make it to the final cut and are chosen for this program.

 

We look forward to their participation and hope they make it to the final selection.

 

Congratulations!

03/01/25, 4:25 pm -  CR1: Subject: Joint “India Semiconductor Workforce Development Program (ISWDP)” | Cohort 4 Announcement and Samsung Fellowships

 

Dear Prof. 

 

Wishing you a Happy New Year! I hope this message finds you in good health and spirits. This is regarding the announcement of Cohort 4 of the India Semiconductor Workforce Development Program (ISWDP), run by the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore, in collaboration with Synopsys Inc., USA, and Samsung Semiconductor India Research (SSIR). ISWDP is a program tailored to bridge the process technology and device design skill gap in the swiftly expanding semiconductor sector through a meticulously designed course, covering the foundational and advanced concepts, also offering a hands-on approach through microelectronics lab experience.

 

The live virtual program comprises four levels, i.e., Level 1, Level 2, Advance, and Custom. Launched in March 2024, the program runs 4 cohorts throughout the year. Following the successful completion of 3 cohorts with over 1500 participants, I am happy to announce that registrations are now open for Cohort 4, starting February 1, 2025 (view the schedule here). Cohort 4 of ISWDP introduces new developments and newer opportunities for students (such as Samsung-sponsored fellowships), and the program’s further expansion (such as an expanded curriculum and industry-sponsored Custom Modules by Tektronix, Inc., and Rohde & Schwarz). More technical details of the program are available at: https://iisc-iswdp.org/pdf/iswdp.pdf

May we request your office to kindly disseminate this information to students and faculties of the concerned departments in your institute by forwarding this email and posting it on respective notice boards?   

 

How to enrol?

There are two ways for students to enrol for ISWDP:

·       Direct Registration: Students can simply click on this link for direct registration: https://iswdp.registeryourseat.in/index.php.

·       Samsung Fellowship: Alternatively, students can fill up the Google Form  https://forms.gle/o4G7sGwNA1uvzm3F7 by January 10th, 2025, to register through the Samsung Fellowship, more details of which can be found here https://iisc-iswdp.org/scholarship.php. Eligible students will be notified via email by January 20th, 2025.  We encourage meritorious students to register through this route.

 

Please note that the slots in each cohort are limited, so prompt action is advisable.

I hope your colleagues and students make the best use of this effort from IISc, Synopsys, and Samsung Semiconductor India Research. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me in case of questions. We will be regularly posting program schedules and other important updates on our LinkedIn page. Those interested in the program can follow us on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/company/iswdp/

 

PS: Institution Heads/ Dept. Heads/ Faculty can write to us at iswdp.msdlab@iisc.ac.in to learn more about the mode of engagement, modalities, and Return on Investment.

Our brightest minds are queuing up in the placement market rather than exploring the excitement of becoming adventurers, thinkers, inventors, and leaders. What is missing here is, contemporary methods of learning beyond the classroom. What is also missing is the dare to go beyond the familiar.

 

We believe young people, who have been exposed to quality education need to take up leadership roles in society. They owe it to themselves, most of all.

 

I urge you to introduce the Fellowship by forwarding this letter to teachers across the campus and introduce us to students who want to accept this dare – and contribute to social and public systems change, besides politics, academia, media, and the corporate world. In the coming decades, we see ourselves developing a pipeline of leaders, builders of solutions and change. We are optimistic that this network will be future collaborators in articulating problems of not just a burgeoning India but also re-visioning and developing judicious solutions for an entire planet.

 

A Small Grant

We support our Fellows with a small grant of Rs 24,500 per month while underwriting board, lodging and communications costs. I can assure you your students and our future Fellows are here to find not just the best jobs but also worthy roles in society.

 

 





 

We look forward to meeting you!
